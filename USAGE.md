## Usage Instructions

Click the `Import Team` button and then paste your Pokemon Showdown! 
Team export into the form. Then, click `Submit`. Once the page loads,
you will see four different tabs.

On the left-hand side at the top of the form you can select the format
for the team to be calced against, as well as options to copy a link
to the clipboard or reset the page. You may also change the level of
all Pokemon, as well as the number of Pokemon displayed.

For more information about the different pages, please see the sections below.

### Damage

This page shows a breakdown of all of the damage calcs for your team
against the common meta threats. This table can be quite overwhelming
at first, since there is a lot of data available. Each cell contains 
the matchup data for your Pokemon (on the X-axis) compared to the 
opponent Pokemon (on the Y-axis).

Hovering over any Pokemon's sprite will show the Showdown-Formatted 
set for the Pokemon, and clicking on any of your Pokemon's sprites 
will toggle the Tera Type of the Pokemon (If a Tera Type is available).

The top half of each contains the damage of your best attack, and the
bottom half of the cell contains the damage for their best attack.
If you hover over either half of the cell, a tooltip will appear 
showing the full damage calc.

On the left-hand side of the page, in addition to the common options
you may also change the sorting, as well as enable or disable several
relevant field effects.

### Speed

This page shows a breakdown of all of the common speed tiers in the metagame, 
compared to your team. Any relevant items will be shown in the sprite, next 
to the sprite for the Pokemon (As well as in the 'Modifier' section.) 

The speed stat, base speed, investment and usage amount are also displayed 
in the table. Your pokemon will be highlighted in green, and will have 
(Your Set) in the 'Modifier' section.

On the left-hand side of the page, in addition to the common options
you may enable or disable held items or abilities from being included.

### Report

This page may take a long time to load - and contains a full report
for your team including speed tiers, damage calcs and more. 

On the left-hand side of the page you may change the team name, 
author, and include or exclude several different sections. 
You may also copy the contents of the report by clicking
the 'Copy Report to Clipboard' option.

### Quiz

This page contains a simple quiz game, with questions related to
damage calcs and speed tiers. It is intended to be used as a 
memorisation tool for playing with your team. 

On the left-hand side of the page you can include or exclude
different types of questions.
